## OPEN TASKS

### High Priority - Code Cleanup

#### TASK-049: Remove Broken Watch Mode
**Priority**: High | **Complexity**: Medium | **Status**: Open

Remove the non-functional watch mode from the codebase to clean up the code and prevent user confusion.

**Background**:
- Watch mode was identified as completely broken during README creation
- Showing broken functionality in documentation/screenshots is unprofessional
- Code contains extensive watch mode implementation that doesn't work

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Remove all watch mode related code from src/watch/ directory
- [ ] Remove watch mode CLI command and arguments from clap
- [ ] Remove ratatui, crossterm, notify dependencies from Cargo.toml
- [ ] Update help text to remove watch mode references
- [ ] Clean up any watch mode imports in main.rs
- [ ] Verify all remaining functionality still works after removal

**Files to modify**:
- `src/main.rs` - Remove watch command handling
- `src/cli.rs` - Remove watch mode CLI arguments
- `src/watch/` - Delete entire directory
- `Cargo.toml` - Remove watch mode dependencies
- Any other files with watch mode imports

### High Priority - Release Ready

#### TASK-045: Automated CI/CD Release Pipeline âœ… COMPLETED
**Priority**: High | **Complexity**: Medium | **Completed**: 2025-06-13

Set up GitHub Actions to build and release static binaries for Linux and macOS.

**COMPLETED**:
- âœ… GitHub Actions workflow builds static binaries on tag push
- âœ… Supports Linux x86_64 (musl target) and macOS (x86_64 + aarch64)
- âœ… Binaries automatically attached to GitHub releases
- âœ… Release notes auto-generated with installation instructions
- âœ… Workflow triggers on version tags (v1.0.0) and manual dispatch
- âœ… CI workflow tests builds across all target platforms
- âœ… Binary verification and cross-platform compatibility testing

**Implementation**:
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Automated release pipeline
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Continuous integration testing
- Support for manual releases via workflow dispatch
- Static linking for Linux (musl) and universal macOS binaries
- Automatic release notes with installation instructions

#### TASK-046: One-Line Install Script âœ… COMPLETED
**Priority**: High | **Complexity**: Low | **Completed**: 2025-06-13

Create Unix-compatible installer script for easy installation.

**COMPLETED**:
- âœ… Shell script detects OS/architecture automatically (Linux/macOS, x86_64/aarch64)
- âœ… Downloads from latest GitHub release API with intelligent fallbacks
- âœ… Installs to `$HOME/.local/bin` (no sudo required)
- âœ… Works with: `curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosarraes/ccost/main/install.sh | sh`
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling with colored output and cleanup
- âœ… Platform validation (Linux x86_64, macOS x86_64/aarch64 supported)
- âœ… Prerequisite checking (curl/wget, tar availability)
- âœ… PATH detection and user guidance
- âœ… Binary verification and testing
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite with 3 test scripts covering all functionality

**Implementation**:
- `install.sh` - Production installer script with OS/arch detection and error handling
- `test_install.sh` - Basic functionality tests
- `test_install_comprehensive.sh` - Comprehensive logic validation tests  
- `test_install_dryrun.sh` - Safe dry-run testing without actual installation
- Integrated with GitHub release workflow for seamless distribution

### Medium Priority - Polish & Enhancement

#### TASK-047: Date Format Configuration âœ… COMPLETED
**Priority**: Medium | **Complexity**: Low | **Completed**: 2025-06-13

Allow users to configure date display format in config file.

- âœ… Update commands to use configured format for display
- âœ… Maintain ISO format for JSON output (always yyyy-mm-dd regardless of config)
- âœ… Default to "yyyy-mm-dd" (ISO standard)
- âœ… Comprehensive DateFormatter utility with full validation
- âœ… Support for date-only and date-time formatting
- âœ… Integration with usage command and daily usage display
- âœ… Updated filter display to use configured date format

**Implementation**:
