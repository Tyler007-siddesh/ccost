## OPEN TASKS

### High Priority - Release Ready

#### TASK-045: Automated CI/CD Release Pipeline âœ… COMPLETED
**Priority**: High | **Complexity**: Medium | **Completed**: 2025-06-13

Set up GitHub Actions to build and release static binaries for Linux and macOS.

**COMPLETED**:
- âœ… GitHub Actions workflow builds static binaries on tag push
- âœ… Supports Linux x86_64 (musl target) and macOS (x86_64 + aarch64)
- âœ… Binaries automatically attached to GitHub releases
- âœ… Release notes auto-generated with installation instructions
- âœ… Workflow triggers on version tags (v1.0.0) and manual dispatch
- âœ… CI workflow tests builds across all target platforms
- âœ… Binary verification and cross-platform compatibility testing

**Implementation**:
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Automated release pipeline
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Continuous integration testing
- Support for manual releases via workflow dispatch
- Static linking for Linux (musl) and universal macOS binaries
- Automatic release notes with installation instructions

#### TASK-046: One-Line Install Script âœ… COMPLETED
**Priority**: High | **Complexity**: Low | **Completed**: 2025-06-13

Create Unix-compatible installer script for easy installation.

**COMPLETED**:
- âœ… Shell script detects OS/architecture automatically (Linux/macOS, x86_64/aarch64)
- âœ… Downloads from latest GitHub release API with intelligent fallbacks
- âœ… Installs to `$HOME/.local/bin` (no sudo required)
- âœ… Works with: `curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosarraes/ccost/main/install.sh | sh`
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling with colored output and cleanup
- âœ… Platform validation (Linux x86_64, macOS x86_64/aarch64 supported)
- âœ… Prerequisite checking (curl/wget, tar availability)
- âœ… PATH detection and user guidance
- âœ… Binary verification and testing
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite with 3 test scripts covering all functionality

**Implementation**:
- `install.sh` - Production installer script with OS/arch detection and error handling
- `test_install.sh` - Basic functionality tests
- `test_install_comprehensive.sh` - Comprehensive logic validation tests  
- `test_install_dryrun.sh` - Safe dry-run testing without actual installation
- Integrated with GitHub release workflow for seamless distribution

### Medium Priority - Polish & Enhancement

#### TASK-047: Date Format Configuration
**Priority**: Medium | **Complexity**: Low

Allow users to configure date display format in config file.

**TODO**:
- [ ] Add date_format option to config: "dd-mm-yyyy", "mm-dd-yyyy", "yyyy-mm-dd"
- [ ] Update commands to use configured format for display
- [ ] Maintain ISO format for JSON output
- [ ] Default to "yyyy-mm-dd" (ISO standard)

```toml
[output]
date_format = "yyyy-mm-dd"
```
